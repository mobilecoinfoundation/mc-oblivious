//! This module defines several "factory traits" that e.g. create recursive
//! ORAMS and control the configuration of recursive children etc.
//!
//! Factories are useful, as opposed to "new_from_..." traits, because a single
//! generic implementation may be often configured in one of several ways.
//! The factory is thus a configuration strategy and they naturally may chain
//! together to create an easy-to-use interface to get an ORAM.
//!
//! This is an alternative to hard-coding constants such as the block size or
//! number of buckets in an ORAM into the implementation code itself, and may
//! make it easier to create automated benchmarks that compare the effects of
//! different settings.
